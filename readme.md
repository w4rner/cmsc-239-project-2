# The Math behind the Music
## Exploring Sounds with The Discrete Fourier Transform

For our Javascript-focussed data vis class, we were tasked with a Final Project of creating an Explainable: a web page explaining a topic using interactive visuals.

We found music to be a common ground between w4rner's artistry as Cerulean and CrimsonRobot & pmj714's physics knowledge!

We hope readers coming at it from either angle will enjoy exploring our web page! You can check it out at: https://w4rner.github.io/cmsc-239-project-2/.
